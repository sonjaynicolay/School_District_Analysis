# School_District_Analysis
##PY City Schools Challenge

###Overview
The school board noticed some evidence of academic dishonesty, specifically amongst 9th graders from Thomas High School, they appear to have been altered. To uphold the state standards they want to have the scores removed and totals calculated without. I have been asked to replace the math and readinig scores from the orginal analysis and then repeat the analysis and describe the effects of the changes made.

###Results


*District Summary


The main district summary chart doesn't show many if any difference. The budget remains the same and technically the amount of students within the district does remain the same, we just will not be incorporating those select students into our new test score results and percentages. The average math & reading scores and percentages stayed stable, however there does eem to be some room for improvement. The overall passing percentage for math & reading is 64.9%. The strongest subject looks to be reading (depending on the results you look at). There did seem to be some fluctuation in percentages and averages the exact cause of that fluctuation is unknown. 

*School Summary

Within the school summary we calculated very similar data but broken down to individual school performance and not the district as a whole. The budgets and school sizes truly vary. Just from a quick glance the schools with more students tend to have lower scores and passing rates than those schools that have less students. This could mean many things. This could possibly mean smaller class sizes, less distracted students or a separation of class. It would be intereating to run an analysis based on the average home income of PY City School students. Thomas High School is listed as a charter school, however without those questionable scores, it appears that they are struggling a bit in with Math, whereas, Wright and Holden High Schools are showing consistent high scores.


*The affects of Replaced Scores


###The replaced scores did affect Thomas High schools scores drastically. Both math and reading did fall. it didn't affect overall averages as much.### 


*How are the following affected?

    *Math & Reading Scores by Grade

    *Scores by school Spending

    *Scores by school Size

    *Scores by School Type

###Summary


Unfortunately I was unable to complete the analysis. However, after the changes made Thomas High School saw lowered math and reading scores and averages. They also moved in rank of schools.  The number of overall passing students did also see a decline. The district will need to make sure they get a hand of the situation to continue to uphold their high standards.
